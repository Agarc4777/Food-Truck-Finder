# FoodTruckFinder

INTRODUCTION

Our projects name is called " Food Truck Finder", as the foodies that we all are, we realized that the food truck sceen was not properly being represented among the food community, so we decided to make an application that list the food trucks near your location.

HOW IT WORKS

The application is simple to use, when the user first get to the page, it will great the user with an awsome pictue of a food truck  and a question asking what type of food the user is looking for followed by a drop down menu that lists all the avaliable categories. When the user selects the catagory desired, the appliciation will  then fetch all the avaliable options corresponding to their current location, in addition to this, we have included a section thats tells the user the weather conditions acording to their location and suggest if they should stay and dine in or pick up and go, or just avoid the area because of horible weather conditions.

CSS FRAMEWORK USED

For this project we decided to use Bulma css framework. Bulma is a free, open source CSS framework based on Flexbox and built with Sass. It's 100% responsive, fully modular, and available for free.

API USED

For this application we decided to use two diffrent  APIs:

GOOGLE PLACES API

https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview
This api was used to pull the users location using their longitude and latitude and populates the results container based on the avaliable food trucks near the users location,

OPEN WEATHER API

https://openweathermap.org/api
This api was used to pull the weather conditions based on the users current location, and makes suggestions on whether the user should stay and dine, or takout.
