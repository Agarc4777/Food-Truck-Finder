# FoodTruckFinder

INTRODUCTION

Our projects name is called " Food Truck Finder", as the foodies that we all are, we realized that the food truck sceen was not properly being represented among the food community, so we decided to make an application that list the food trucks near the users location.

HOW IT WORKS

The application is simple to use, when the user first visits the page, it will great the user with an awsome pictue of a food truck and a beautiful page layout. The application, in the background, will then get the users location, and then it will fetch all the avaliable  food truck results corresponding to ther users current location, in addition to this, we have included a section thats tells the user the weather conditions acording to their location and suggest if they should stay and dine in or pick up and go, or just avoid the area because of horible weather conditions.

CSS FRAMEWORK USED

For this project we decided to use Bulma css framework. Bulma is a free, open source CSS framework based on Flexbox and built with Sass. It's 100% responsive, fully modular, and available for free.

API USED

For this application we decided to use two diffrent  APIs:

GOOGLE PLACES API

https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview
This api was used to pull the users location using their longitude and latitude and populates the results container based on the avaliable food trucks near the users location,

OPEN WEATHER API

https://openweathermap.org/api
This api was used to pull the weather conditions based on the users current location, and makes suggestions on whether the user should stay and dine, or takout.  

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

Our plans for future development of this project is to add the ability to give direction to a specific food truck from the application as well as the ability to display that food trucks schedule.

CHALLENGES FACED

 finding APIs that worked on the client side not just the server side.
